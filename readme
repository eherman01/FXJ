This is the readme file of FXJ
FXJ is a project created as part of a bachelors thesis in informatics at the University Of Skövde
It compares extrapolation with intrapolation as a method for local lag compensation in first person shooters.
This file is pretty fucking pointless. It only exists so that Source Tree will not crash when i try to clone this fucking repo.
FXJ stands for Fitt Exjobb because i hate my life and i cannot wait to get this shit over with.

mvh vill dö
